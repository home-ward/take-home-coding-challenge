## Backend Take Home Coding Challenge

Please organize, design, test, and document your code as if it were going into production. If you create design
documentation, we would love to see it. If you have ideas about how this project could best be deployed, bring
those thoughts with you. No need to deploy the project, just be ready to discuss how you might do it.

### Challenge Description
#### You do not need to consider the data structure as correct or complete. Please feel free to edit what is already supplied.
We currently have data saved for customers applying to use Homeward services. We have application information and the 
related customer and agent information. We would like to create an API that allows us to interact with the agent data.

### Requirements
Create an agent API that allows for GET, POST, and PATCH requests. 
- For a GET request, we would like to see the agent's name, contact information, and location (city, state). 
- For a new GET request, we would like to return a specific real estate agent that is already connected to a specific customer. 
- For a new GET request, we would like to be able to return a list of agents based on a specific location.
- For a POST request, we would like to add a new agent to the database.
- For a PATCH request, we would like to update an agent's information.

### Make sure to include:
- Data models (You can add data models, add to the fixtures available, or anything else you need)
- Endpoints
- Services
- Any utility functions needed
